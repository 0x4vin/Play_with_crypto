## Overview
This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using two classic cryptographic algorithms:

1. RSA Encryption
2. Playfair Cipher

Users can choose between these two encryption methods and follow the guided steps for each. The RSA encryption system will calculate the public and private keys based on the provided prime numbers, while the Playfair cipher will encrypt messages using a provided key.
